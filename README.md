# python_boggle
Boggle game in python

Game currently randomly positions 16 die on a 4 x 4 grid and randomly selects a letter to display mimicking the die game Boggle. It also includes a countdown timer.

Possible future work could include:
- allowing players to type in words
- automatically checking if the words are allowable and totalling the score
- having the computer find all possible words
